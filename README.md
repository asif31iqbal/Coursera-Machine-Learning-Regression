# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Regression
## IPython notebook Solutions (with data) for University of Washington's Machine Learning Regression course on Coursera 
This course goes somewhat deep in regression methods and regularization (L1 and L2), along with hands-on exercises. From the 
course page "In this course, you will explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature 
selection.  You will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity.  
You will also analyze the impact of aspects of your data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.  
To fit these models, you will implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.".
